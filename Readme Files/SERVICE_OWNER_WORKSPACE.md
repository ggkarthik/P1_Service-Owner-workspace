# Service Owner Workspace

## Overview

The **Service Owner Workspace** is an AI-native dashboard designed for business service owners who need to manage security risk at a service level. It provides a comprehensive view of cyber risk, remediation progress, business impact, and AI-powered recommendations in a cohesive, interactive layout.

> **Note:** The Service Owner Workspace is now fully integrated into the Microservices tab. Simply click on any service card in the Microservices tab to access its Service Owner Dashboard.

## Key Features

### 🎯 Two-Layered Experience

The workspace provides two distinct views to cater to different needs:

#### 1. **High-Level View** (Executive Overview)
A strategic dashboard for quick assessment and decision-making:

- **Service Risk Score**: Large, prominent risk score (0-100) with business impact classification
- **Risk Trend Visualization**: 30-day trend chart showing risk evolution
- **Service Composition**: Visual diagram showing the service and its dependencies
- **Exposure Overview**: Bar charts showing vulnerability distribution by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- **Remediation Progress**: Key metrics including:
  - Number of breaches
  - Mean Time To Remediate (MTTR)
  - Assigned teams count
  - Open, In Progress, and Overdue vulnerabilities
- **Compliance Posture**: Circular progress indicator showing:
  - Adherence score
  - Applicable frameworks (PCI-DSS, SOC 2, ISO 27001, etc.)
  - Failed controls count
- **AI Insights & Recommendations**: AI-powered insights including:
  - Threat predictions and trends
  - Prioritized remediation recommendations
  - Business impact analysis
  - Next best actions

#### 2. **Granular View** (Detailed Analysis)
A comprehensive view for deep-dive analysis and action:

- **Vulnerability Table**: Detailed list of all vulnerabilities with:
  - Unique ID and CVE reference
  - Vulnerability type
  - Severity level (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
  - CVSS score
  - Affected package
  - Current status (Open, In Progress, Resolved, Mitigated)
  - Assigned team
  - Action buttons for remediation
- **Advanced Filtering**: Filter vulnerabilities by severity level
- **AI Recommendations**: Contextual recommendations based on selected vulnerabilities with:
  - Priority level
  - Business impact assessment
  - Effort estimation

### 🤖 Conversational AI Copilot

An intelligent chatbot that helps service owners:

- Understand security risks and their implications
- Get recommendations for remediation actions
- Query vulnerability details and compliance status
- Analyze business impact and risk trends
- Answer questions about MTTR and remediation progress

**Sample Queries:**
- "What is my current risk score?"
- "How many critical vulnerabilities do I have?"
- "What should I prioritize?"
- "What is the compliance status?"
- "What is the MTTR for this service?"

### 📊 Service Selection

- Grid view of all microservices with:
  - Service name and description
  - Risk level badge (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
  - Programming language
  - Total vulnerability count
- Click any service to view its detailed risk profile

## Data Generated

The workspace uses data generated by `generate_service_owner_data.py`, which creates:

### For Each Service:
